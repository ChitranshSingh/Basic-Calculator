-   **Keyboard Support**: Type directly for a faster workflow.

### 🔬 Scientific Calculator (Toggle On!)

Unleash the power of advanced mathematics with a simple toggle switch:

-   **Trigonometric Functions**: `sin`, `cos`, `tan` (converts degrees to radians for calculation).
-   **Logarithmic Functions**: `log` (base 10), `ln` (natural logarithm).
-   **Powers**: `x²` (square), `x³` (cube), `xʸ` (custom power).
-   **Roots**: `√` (square root), `∛` (cube root).
-   **Constants**: `π` (Pi), `e` (Euler's number).
-   **Factorial (`x!`)**: Calculate factorials for non-negative integers.
-   **Inverse (`1/x`)**: Find the reciprocal of a number.
-   **Toggle Sign (`±`)**: Switch between positive and negative values.
-   **Absolute Value (`|x|`)**: Get the absolute value of a number.
-   **Memory Functions**: `MS` (Memory Store), `MR` (Memory Recall), `M+` (Memory Add), `MC` (Memory Clear).

### 🌌 Captivating Background Animation

Dive into an immersive mathematical universe with a mesmerizing canvas animation:

-   **Dynamic Symbols**: Watch as `π`, `∑`, `∫`, `√`, `÷`, `×`, `+`, `-`, `=`, `e`, `ln`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `∞` float and interact.
-   **Iconic Formulas**: Gaze upon `E=mc²`, `F=ma`, `a²+b²=c²`, `e^(iπ)+1=0`, `f'(x)`, `∫f(x)dx` drifting across your screen.
-   **Responsive Design**: The animation adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

### 🎨 Stunning User Interface

Experience a calculator that's as beautiful as it is functional:

-   **Glassmorphism Design**: Enjoy a modern, frosted glass effect with subtle shadows and borders.
-   **Vibrant Gradients**: A captivating `linear-gradient` background sets the mood.
-   **Interactive Buttons**: Buttons respond with delightful hover and active states, complete with subtle light effects.
-   **Custom Scrollbar**: Even the scrollbar is styled to match the aesthetic!
-   **Responsive Layout**: The calculator adjusts gracefully to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on any device.

## 🛠️ Technologies Under the Hood

-   **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the calculator and its components.
-   **CSS3**: Powering the stunning visual design, animations, and responsiveness.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Bringing all the interactive functionality to life, from basic operations to complex scientific calculations and the background animation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To experience the Modern Calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No installation or complex setup required!

## 💡 How to Use

1.  **Standard Operations**: Click the number buttons and operation symbols (`+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`) to perform calculations.
2.  **Clear/Delete**: Use `AC` to clear all input and `DEL` to remove the last digit.
3.  **Scientific Mode**: Toggle the switch in the header to reveal and utilize the scientific functions.
4.  **Keyboard Input**: Use your keyboard's number pad and operation keys for quick input.
